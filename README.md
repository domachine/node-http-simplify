# node-http-simplify

This is just an experiment. I wanted to see how fast I could wire up a
connect like middleware system for http requests. Yeah about 10
minutes :).

The result is a super tiny application with a middleware stack and a
blazing fast router. Everything is done using plain node.js. No
dependencies required.
